<h2 >How it started</h2>
<br>
  <p >• Started the semester wanting to do something with illustration, coding, and interaction design</p>
  <p >• Interested in the ideas of isolation and connection after being an online student during the pandemic</p>
  <p >• Making some kind of digital and physical interactive experience was my original goal</p>
  <p >• I struggled to explain my idea during the interviews because I wasn't sure of my idea myself</p>

        <p>• Studio Moniker is an Amsterdam based interactive design studio researching the social effects of technology</p>
        <p>• Their <i>Puff Up Club</i> project had visitors of their website press to puff up a balloon, creating a real life effect from digital interaction</p>
        <p>• This project and their work in general involves just the kind of interactions I am interested in for my own project</p>

      <div class="panel">
        <p>• Laurel Schwulst is an artist, designer and writer </p>
        <p>• I first heard about her work a few years ago when I read her article <i> "My website is a shifting house next to a river of knowledge. What could yours be?”</i> I read this article when I first started coding and it definitely impacted my view of the web and I would say inadvertently helped inspire my project </p>
        <p>• The web is very big and also very small and Laurel Schwulst's work has often made me think about that idea. Even if we are all on our own computers the web still brings us together if we make the spaces for it</p>

          <p>• Zach Lieberman creates artwork with code, well known for his daily code sketches </p>
          <p>• Every day he posts on his Instagram a new experimental "sketch" made with code. I was inspired to do this myself and have been for the last few weeks </p>
          <p>• He sets parameters for his daily sketches (certain colours, for example) and pursues results he finds interesting, which I think is a very cool way of approaching the act of making</p>

      <p>• I've been making daily code sketches in p5.js based on Zach Lieberman's daily code sketch idea, making whatever I think of or want to try. He adds and changes parameters to his sketches, which is an idea I may try to incorporate in the future as currently I have let it be open</p>

      <p>• Project 1 has been my main focus this semester, I wanted to build my technical skills to help me for the rest of the year. I created 3 web experiments, each building a different skill and following a single fish character</p>
  <p>• I learned a lot of practical coding skills but was lacking on conceptual development. I did also learn more about what direction I'd like to take my workshop project based on what I enjoyed about this project</p>

      <div class="panel">
        <p>• I spent a lot of time online during the pandemic, thought a lot about nostalgic websites and online games</p>
        <p>• Geocities, old Nintento systems, and websites like Club Penguin served as inspiration to me and I thought about how the Internet has changed but how nostalgia brings certain things back</p>
        <p>• Moving a bit away from the idea of digital and physical interaction and more towards how online games can fill a need for human connection and how this idea has evolved from the past, to present post-pandemic life</p>

      <div class="panel">
        <p>• It’s hard to say with certainty where this project will go because if I’ve learned anything over the last month and a half, it's that I will change my mind a lot and that is okay</p>
        <p>• Short-term, my next project will have to focus on developing my thesis idea and continuing to research. Maybe returning to the idea of having several web experiments, but with a much stronger conceptual focus and thinking more about user interaction</p>
        <p>• Thinking about the "why" and about narrative</p>
